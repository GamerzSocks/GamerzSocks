- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GamerzSocks, but just call me Gamerz.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in just chillin' and making random fun stuff in vbs and maybe other things. I also like video games and Homebrew, well as annoying my friends and being that one nerdy person to do simple distruptive stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use python, to make some simple interfaces.

- Skills:
- VBScript (OK)
- Very basic C and Makefile
- Minimal understanding on Python
- can read java
